Improving Network Intrusion Detection Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models with Feature Selection using the UNSW-NB15 Dataset

This project is part of my requirement for MSc in Cyber Security.

The code is implemented using Python3, utilising the Google Colab environment.

Requirements:

1- The full UNSW-NB15 Dataset (4 CSV files). Available at: https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/personal/z5025758_ad_unsw_edu_au/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fz5025758%5Fad%5Funsw%5Fedu%5Fau%2FDocuments%2FUNSW%2DNB15%20dataset&ga=1
